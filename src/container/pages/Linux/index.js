                <p>A time zone is a geographic region that has the same standard time. Typically the time zone is set during the installation of the operational system, but it can be easily changed at a later time.</p>
                <p>Using the correct time zone is essential for many systems related tasks and processes. For example, the cron daemon uses the systemâ€™s time zone for executing cron jobs. The time zone is also used for logs timestamps.</p>
